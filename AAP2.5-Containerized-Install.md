## üèóÔ∏è Architecture Overview

AAP 2.5 shifts from a monolithic, RPM-based installation to a suite of containerized microservices running on Podman. This modern architecture improves component isolation and security but introduces new operational complexities.

### Key Components

* **Automation Controller**: The core engine for orchestrating Ansible Playbooks, managing inventory, and providing Role-Based Access Control (RBAC).
* **Private Automation Hub (PAH)**: A local repository for managing and distributing certified and custom automation content, including collections and execution environments.
* **Event-Driven Ansible (EDA) Controller**: Processes real-time events from various sources to trigger automated responses.
* **Platform Gateway**: A unified entry point and reverse proxy for all UI and API interactions, routing requests to the appropriate backend service.

### "Container Growth Topology"

This guide focuses on the **single-node topology**, which installs all core components‚ÄîController, Hub, EDA, Database, and Redis‚Äîas containers on a single RHEL host.

> **‚ö†Ô∏è Important Consideration**: This topology represents a **single point of failure**. A hardware or OS-level issue on the node will result in a complete platform outage. Scaling to a multi-node setup requires a full migration, not an in-place upgrade.

## üñ•Ô∏è Host Environment Preparation

Meticulous host preparation is the most effective way to prevent common installation failures and ensure long-term operational health.

### Hardware Recommendations

While Red Hat defines minimums, these recommendations are strongly advised for production environments.

| Component | Minimum Requirement | **Production Recommendation** | Verification Command |
| :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **CPU Cores** | 4  | **8+**  | `lscpu \| grep '^CPU(s):'`  |
| **RAM** | 16 GB  | **32 GB+**  | `free -g`  |
| **Disk Space** | 60 GB  | **150 GB+**  | `df -h /`  |
| **/var/tmp Space** | 3 GB (Offline)  | **12 GB+** | `df -h /var/tmp`  |
| **Disk IOPS** | 3000  | **3000+**  | `fio`  |

### System & Network Prerequisites

* **OS**: Red Hat Enterprise Linux 9.2 or a later minor version of RHEL 9.
* **Subscriptions**: Both RHEL (for BaseOS and AppStream) and AAP subscriptions must be attached and current.
* **Software**: The `ansible-core` package (version 2.14) must be installed from RHEL repositories before running the installer.
* **Hostname**: The host must have a static, DNS-resolvable Fully Qualified Domain Name (FQDN).
* **Dedicated User**: The installation must be run by a dedicated non-root user (e.g., `aap`) with passwordless `sudo` privileges.
* **SELinux**: Must be enabled and in `Enforcing` mode.
* **Firewall Ports**: The following ports must be open for inbound traffic:
    * `80/TCP` (HTTP Redirect)
    * `443/TCP` (HTTPS UI/API)
    * `27199/TCP` (Receptor Control Plane)

## üöÄ Step-by-Step Installation

### 1. Obtain the Installer

Download the "Ansible Automation Platform 2.5 Containerized Setup Bundle" from the Red Hat Customer Portal and unpack it on the host.

```bash
tar xfvz ansible-automation-platform-containerized-setup-bundle-*.tar.gz
```

### 2. Configure the Inventory

The inventory file is the central configuration for the deployment:.

1.  Copy the template: `cp inventory-growth inventory-prod`.
2.  **Host Definitions**: Ensure the host's FQDN is listed under all component groups (`[automationgateway]`, `[automationcontroller]`, etc.).
3.  **Variable Configuration (`[all:vars]`)**: Set all required variables. **Passwords should be secured with Ansible Vault**.

    ```ini
    # Example inventory-prod snippet
    [all:vars]
    ansible_connection=local

    # Use a Registry Service Account from cloud.redhat.com
    registry_username = '1234567|aap_installer'
    registry_password = '<your_service_account_token>'

    # Admin passwords (use ansible-vault to encrypt these)
    postgresql_admin_password = '<strong_password_1>'
    gateway_admin_password = '<strong_password_2>'
    controller_admin_password = '<strong_password_3>'
    hub_admin_password = '<strong_password_4>'

    # Paths for custom TLS certs (configure in hardening step)
    # gateway_ssl_cert = '/path/to/aap.crt'
    # gateway_ssl_key = '/path/to/aap.key'
    # custom_ca_cert = '/path/to/ca.pem'
    ```

### 3. Execute the Playbook

Run the installer from within the unpacked directory.

```bash
# For production, use Ansible Vault for passwords
ansible-playbook -i inventory-prod --ask-vault-pass -e @vars/secrets.yml ansible.containerized_installer.install
```

### 4. Post-Installation Verification

1.  **Check Container Status**: Ensure all service containers are running.
    ```bash
    podman ps --format "{{.Names}}"
    ```
2.  **Inspect Logs**: If a container is failing, check its logs using `journald`.
    ```bash
    journalctl CONTAINER_NAME=automation-controller-web
    ```
3.  **UI and Subscription Check**: Log in to `https://<your_fqdn>` and verify that the UI is accessible and the AAP subscription is recognized as compliant.

## üîí Security Hardening

### Custom SSL/TLS Certificates

The default self-signed certificates are not suitable for production and should be replaced with certificates from a trusted Certificate Authority (CA).

1.  Obtain a certificate, private key, and CA bundle for your FQDN.
2.  Place the files on the AAP host.
3.  Uncomment and set the `gateway_ssl_cert`, `gateway_ssl_key`, and `custom_ca_cert` variables in your inventory file.
4.  Re-run the installer playbook.

> **üö® Receptor TLS Warning**: The `receptor` service can fail its TLS handshake with wildcard certificates. It is **highly recommended** to issue a certificate with the specific FQDN of the AAP host listed as a Subject Alternative Name (SAN). Failure can cause jobs to be stuck in a "pending" state indefinitely.

### Credential Management

* **External Vaults**: For mature environments, integrate with an external secrets manager like HashiCorp Vault or CyberArk Conjur. This allows AAP to fetch credentials dynamically at runtime, centralizing secret management.
* **RBAC Model**: Use Organizations and Teams to delegate access and enforce separation of duties. Strictly limit the number of System Administrators.
* **Centralized Logging**: Forward logs to a central platform (Splunk, Elastic) for auditing and compliance. Configure this in the Controller UI under `Settings > Logging Settings`.

## üõ†Ô∏è Monitoring, Backup, and Recovery

### Monitoring Strategy

Monitor the platform at three distinct layers to ensure visibility.

1.  **Host System**: Monitor CPU, memory, disk space, and I/O using tools like Prometheus Node Exporter.
2.  **Container Runtime**: Monitor container status (running, restarting) and resource usage with a tool like `prometheus-podman-exporter`.
3.  **Application Performance**: Scrape the Prometheus-compatible endpoint at `/api/controller/v2/metrics/` to track running jobs (`awx_jobs_running`), active sessions (`awx_sessions_total`), and queue depth.

### Backup and Restore

* **Supported Method**: Use **only** the playbooks provided by the installer collection (`ansible.containerized_installer.backup` and `ansible.containerized_installer.restore`). Manual methods like `pg_dump` are unsupported and will likely result in a non-functional restoration.
* **Backup Command**:
    ```bash
    ansible-playbook -i inventory-prod ansible.containerized_installer.backup
    ```
* **Critical Practice**: Backups should be run regularly and the resulting archives **copied to a secure, off-host location**.

## ‚öôÔ∏è Advanced Enterprise Configuration

### Content Management

* **Private Automation Hub (PAH)**: Use PAH as a local, curated repository for all automation content. Synchronize certified collections from Red Hat and upload custom-developed content. Configure the Controller to use PAH as its exclusive source for collections to ensure only vetted content is used.

### Execution Environments (EEs)

* **Consistent Runtimes**: EEs are container images that bundle all dependencies (`ansible-core`, collections, Python libraries) required for automation to run, solving the "dependency hell" problem.
* **Build Custom EEs**: Use the `ansible-builder` utility to create custom EEs, publish them to PAH's container registry, and assign them to Job Templates in the Controller.

### GitOps Integration

* **Source Control**: All Ansible Playbooks and roles should be stored and managed in a source control system like Git.
* **Controller Projects**: Configure Projects in the Controller to point to Git repositories. This ensures you are always running the latest, version-controlled automation code and enables peer review and rollback capabilities.
